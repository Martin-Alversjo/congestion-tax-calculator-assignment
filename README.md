## Congestion Tax Calculator

I thought this was a very fun code assignment. Had a hard time to finish it within the time limit (even though I worked on it a little bit longer). Hopefully I got the bugs solved atleast.

Things I should have done diffrentely:

### 1. I should maybe have taken more time to plan before I started coding and maybe scaled down some things

### 2. Instead of using Context I should have used a express server and going for HTTP requests to that one

### 3. Spend more time refactoring the Tax Calculator, creating more functions (e.g extracted if statements)

### 4. Look over the naming of the types

### 5. Added support for adding more than 1 date per vehicle

### 6. Created more helper functions for the date handling

### 7. Should have added a middleware for next js rendering

To start the app:

npm:
npm install
npm run dev

yarn:
yarn install
yarn dev
