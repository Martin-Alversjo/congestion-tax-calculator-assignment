### Congestion Tax Calculator

#### Info about the assignment

This was a very fun code assignment. Had a hard time to finish it within the time limit (even though I worked on it just a little bit longer).

#### What I achived

1.  Create an entry point for the function
2.  Add new tax calculations
3.  Get a visible list of all tax calculations
4.  The bugs that existed are fixed (hopefully all of them)
5.  Made an app to build upon (e.g just add more actions to the reducer)

#### Things I should have done differently or that I did not have time to implement:

1.  I should maybe have taken more time to plan before I started coding and maybe scaled down some things
2.  Instead of using Context I should have used a express server and going for HTTP requests to that one
3.  Spend more time refactoring the Tax Calculator, creating more functions (e.g extracted if statements)
4.  Look over the naming of the types
5.  Added support for adding more than 1 date per vehicle
6.  Created more helper functions for the date handling
7.  Should have added a middleware for next js rendering

#### To start the app:

npm:
npm install
npm run dev

yarn:
yarn install
yarn dev
